My name is Matthew Hall. I am 13 years old my house is somewhere in greenwich(idk man), where most of the houses are,i am not married i spend most of my day going so school at ark. i get home every day by around 5pm the latest. I dont vape but i occasionally eat snacks
im in bed by 3 and i make sure to neglect my sleep as much as possible. after having a warm glass of milk and doing 20 mins of streches, i do not fall asleep. i wake up just like a miserable middle aged man with a 7- 12 job (help)

i was tole that there were no issues at my last checkup however, my dentist recommended i put rubber bands on my braces. im trying to explain that i am a boy who wishes to live a very normal life. i take care not to trouble myself with enemies or winning and losing that would cause me to lose sleep at night.that is how i deal with society and i know that is what brings me happieness. Although if i were to fight,i would never lose
